## **1. Business Understanding**
### By analyzing the factors that have an impact on the Green Index score, the client can allocate resources efficiently and effectively to address the most pressing environmental challenges. By tracking changes in each factor over time, Breda can set realistic goals and monitor its progress toward becoming more sustainable in a completely data-driven manner. We will analyze the correlation between Quality of life, Public Safety, Segregation, and Environmental statistics with the green index score to determine if we are able to predict a green index score using regression task for each neighborhood in Breda. ​
## **2. Research Questions**
### 1. What are the factors that might contribute to the green index score?​
### 2. Based on these factors, can we predict a green index score?​

### **Success criteria**
For this project, our success criteria is to develop a tool, which is based on Machine Learning Algorithm, to predict green score on given values of selected metrics.

## **5. Tools and Resources for Improving Greenery in Breda:**

1. **Data Visualization Tools:** Visualization tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Matplotlib can be used to create interactive and informative visualizations that showcase the impact of green initiatives on various metrics. Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy can be used for data preprocessing, while libraries like Plotly, Matplotlib, or Folium can be utilized for interactive data visualization.

2. **Machine Learning and AI Algorithms:** Machine learning and AI algorithms can be utilized for tasks such as data analysis. The scikit-learn library in Python provides essential functionality for creating and evaluating machine learning models. Regression tasks such as Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression can be employed to determine the best-performing model for predicting and optimizing greenery-related metrics.

3. **Open Data Sources:** Leveraging open data sources, such as the Breda in Cijfers website, can provide valuable information on factors like population per neighborhood and the number of houses in Breda. These sources can aid in understanding the existing environmental conditions and identifying opportunities for improvement.

4. **Collaborative Platforms:** Collaborative platforms like GitHub or GitLab can facilitate team collaboration and version control of code and data. They enable data scientists and AI practitioners to work together efficiently and ensure reproducibility of analyses.

5. **Client Engagement:** Engaging with the Data Science Team of the Municipality of Breda is crucial to understand the goals and requirements of the project. This collaboration helps in identifying the specific needs and priorities of Breda and enables the development of tailored solutions for improving greenery throughout the city.

These tools and resources collectively contribute to data-driven decision-making, efficient analysis, and effective communication of insights, ultimately aiding in the successful implementation of green initiatives in Breda.
