### ***Week 4: Business & Data Understanding***
**SCRUM Master: Kacper Janczyk**
- Familiarize ourselves with the project goals and objectives. (including working with Trello workspace)
- Conduct meetings with the client to gain a deeper understanding of their requirements.
- Identify the key factors affecting the Green Index score (Quality of life, Public Safety, Segregation, Environmental statistics).
- Gather relevant data sources for each factor and understand their structure and format.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data and identify any data quality issues or missing values.

***Summary:***

*During Week 4, as part of Team Greenscape, we focused on understanding the project goals and requirements. We had meetings with the client (sounding board session), identified  possible factors impacting the Green Index score, gathered relevant data sources, and conducted exploratory data analysis to uncover insights and address any data quality issues.
We were able to set up Trello workspace board for this Sprint, and set up more or less the product backlog. Personally, as a SCRUM master during this week, I made sure to get familiarized with whole structure of Sprints and implement it to our team's workflow. We were able to deliver quality presentation of our project's idea during Sounding Board session with DS team from Gemeente Breda, which was sucessful considering the fact, that DS team liked our approach and was interested in the final outcome of predicting Green Index Score, since as they mentioned, it is mostly used as an X variable in multiple ML algorithms developed within team of Breda's municipality.*

### ***Week 5: Data Preparation***
**SCRUM Master: Yuliia Bobrovystka**
- Cleanse and preprocess the data to address any data quality issues, such as missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies.
- Perform feature engineering to create new variables or transformations that may improve the predictive power of the model.
- Integrate the data from different sources and ensure it is in a suitable format for modeling.
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model accurately.
- Document the data preparation steps taken for transparency and reproducibility.

***Summary:***



### ***Week 6: Modeling***
**SCRUM Master: Collin Limoncelli-Buyskes**
- Select an appropriate regression algorithm to predict the Green Index score based on the identified factors.
- Train the regression model on the prepared dataset.
- Optimize the model by tuning hyperparameters and using techniques such as cross-validation.
- Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared).
- Consider ensemble methods or feature selection techniques to improve model performance if necessary.

***Summary:***



### ***Week 7: Evaluation***
**SCRUM Master: Simona Dimitrova**
- Assess the model's predictive accuracy by comparing the predicted Green Index scores with the actual scores in the validation set.
- Perform additional analysis to understand the model's strengths and limitations.
- Identify any biases or limitations in the data and model, and discuss potential ways to mitigate them.
- Collaborate with the client to validate the model's usefulness in addressing their goals and requirements.
- Document the evaluation results and recommendations for future improvements.

***Summary:***



### ***Week 8: Deployment***
**SCRUM Master: Matyas Tatar**
- Finalize the regression model based on the evaluation and feedback received.
- Apply the trained model to predict the Green Index scores for each neighborhood in Breda.
- Generate a comprehensive report summarizing the findings, including the model's performance, feature importance, and insights into the factors affecting the Green Index score.
- Present the report to the client and stakeholders, explaining the results and potential implications for resource allocation and sustainability efforts.
- Provide recommendations on how to monitor and update the model in the future as new data becomes available.
- Collaborate with the client to develop an implementation plan for integrating the model into their decision-making processes.
