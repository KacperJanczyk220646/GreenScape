- Could the AI system affect human autonomy by generating over-reliance by end-users?
### Did you put in place procedures to avoid that end-users over-rely on the AI system?
- Could the AI system affect human autonomy by interfering with the end-userâ€™s decision-making process in any other unintended and undesirable way?
- Did you put in place any procedure to avoid that the AI system inadvertently affects human autonomy?
- Does the AI system simulate social interaction with or between end-users or subjects?
